<h3>About Raoul</h3>
	
    <p>  After graduating college in engineering, I worked briefly in the HVAC field and</p>  
<p>      then in the technical support field. I found that I enjoy applying myself in a </p>
<p>	 creative field and enjoy working in a team.</p>
	 
<p>      I recently found coding as an interest and love the aspect of being able to create </p>
<p>	 and design content online. This would also be a great learning tool for creating,</p>
<p>	 advertising, and marketing content.</p>
